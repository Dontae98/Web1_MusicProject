     <h1>ABOUT</h1>
   </div>

   <div class="maincontent">
     <p>Singer-songwriter Bruno Mars was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii. By the early 2000s, he had begun to find success by writing songs for popular artists, including K'Naan's "Wavin' Flag." After several years as one of pop music's premier songwriters, Mars broke out as a singer in his own right with the 2010 hit "Nothin' on You." Other popular songs by Mars include "Just the Way You Are" (2010), "Locked Out of Heaven" (2012) and the Grammy-winning tracks "Uptown Funk" (2015) and "That's What I Like" (2017).</p>

    <p>After several years as one of the pop music industry's premier songwriters, Mars finally broke out as a singer in his own right with the 2010 hit "Nothin' on You." The song was written for the Atlantic Records rapper B.o.B., but the record label decided to enlist Mars himself to croon the heartfelt chorus. The track proved an enormous hit, skyrocketing to No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart, and instantly transforming Bruno Mars from a behind-the-scenes composer into a pop performer.</p>

    <p>Mars continued his immensely successful run with the release of his third studio effort, 24K Magic, in November 2016. The album included the catchy title track, a retro-tinted dance number in the vein of "Uptown Funk," as well as the sultry "That's What I Like," which climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

    <p>Mars cleaned up at the 2018 Grammy Awards, winning in all six categories for which he drew nominations, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Song of the Year. He also delivered a quality performance alongside Cardi B for his latest single, "Finesse," cementing his standing as arguably the top all-around act in the business.</p>
